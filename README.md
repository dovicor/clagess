CLAGESS - CLaiming AGe Estimator for Social Security retirement benefits

(Social Security is the government managed retirement system in the USA administered by the SSA (Social Security Administration) - see https://www.ssa.gov/ and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)).

Claiming age is the age at which the enrollee receives the first retirement benefit payment.
Under US law, this can be any month between the 62nd and 70th birthdays. Each month of deferment will result in a slightly larger monthly benefit amount. This software helps potential enrollees determine the tradeoffs of claiming benefits at different ages.

Note, Social Security provides numerous other forms of benefits other than retirement benefits - such as for people with disabilities. And the retirement benefits has special rules when dealing with spouses - either surviving or after divorce.  This software does not deal with these cases.

This package consists of a Javascript module - clagess.js and an index.html to provide an example of its use.

clagess.js will present the user with a form - the user may input various information such as birth-year and birth-month
and PIA (primary insurance amount - as determined by the SSA - Social Security Administration). clagess.js will then produce
a month-by-month table that compares details across multiple claiming ages.

clagess.js requires the chart.js library.
